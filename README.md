# AoC 2022
For this annual christmas programming task, I'm trying to fix all days' bug without using that fifth alpha-glyph, which sits by "d" and "f".

To launch my solutions, I'm using a command with a taboo symbol in it, but only on my Windows spot.
On Linux, I'd put `cat day1.txt | python day1-1.py`.
